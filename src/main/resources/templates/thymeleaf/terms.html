			respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while
			operating our websites.
		</p>
		<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
		<p>Like most website operators, Wisdom Spring Technologies
			collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
			browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
			type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of
			each visitor request. Wisdom Spring Technologies purpose in
			collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
			understand how Wisdom Spring Technologies visitors use its
			website. From time to time, Wisdom Spring Technologies may
			release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate,
			e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
		<p>Wisdom Spring Technologies also collects potentially
			personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
			addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on
			s4sq.org blogs/sites. Wisdom Spring Technologies only
			discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
			circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
			information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses
			and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators
			of the blog/site where the comment was left.</p>
		<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
		<p>
			Certain visitors to Wisdom Spring Technologies websites choose
			to interact with Wisdom Spring Technologies in ways that
			require Wisdom Spring Technologies to gather
			personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
			information that Wisdom Spring Technologies gathers depends on
			the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign
			up at <a href="http://s4sq.org">s4sq.org</a> to provide a username
			and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Wisdom Spring Technologies are asked to provide additional
			information, including as necessary the personal and financial
			information required to process those transactions. In each case,
			Wisdom Spring Technologies collects such information only
			insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the
			visitor's interaction with Wisdom Spring Technologies. Wisdom Spring Technologies does not disclose personally-identifying
			information other than as described below. And visitors can always
			refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat
			that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
			activities.

		<p>Wisdom Spring Technologies may collect statistics about
			the behavior of visitors to its websites. Wisdom Spring Technologies may display this information publicly or provide it to

			those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that
			(i) need to know that information in order to process it on Wisdom Spring Technologies behalf or to provide services available at
			Wisdom Spring Technologies websites, and (ii) that have agreed
			not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors
			and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home
			country; by using Wisdom Spring Technologies websites, you
			consent to the transfer of such information to them. Wisdom Spring Technologies will not rent or sell potentially
			personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
			anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
			organizations, as described above, Wisdom Spring Technologies

			personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena,
			court order or other governmental request, or when Wisdom Spring Technologies believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
			necessary to protect the property or rights of Wisdom Spring Technologies, third parties or the public at large. If you are a
			registered user of an Wisdom Spring Technologies website and
			have supplied your email address, Wisdom Spring Technologies
			may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features,
			solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going
			on with Wisdom Spring Technologies and our products. If you
			send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback
			mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us

		<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
		<p>If Wisdom Spring Technologies, or substantially all of
			its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Wisdom Spring Technologies goes out of business or enters bankruptcy,
			user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or
			acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may
